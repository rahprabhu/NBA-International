# The Rise of International Players in the NBA

### About
The NBA has grown into a global game over the last few decades, and I would like to do an EDA on the growth of international players in the NBA and better classify the players using clustering techniques. Before beginning the clustering exercise, some questions that I would like to answer include:
- What are the top countries that international players have come from?
- Which countries have the highest average career lengths in the NBA in terms of games played?
- Which countries contributed the most to winning games?
- Which countries have produced the best scorers?
